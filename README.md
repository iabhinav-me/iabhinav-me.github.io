# Firebase Redirect to iAbhinav.me

This project sets up Firebase Hosting to **redirect all traffic** to [https://iabhinav.me](https://iabhinav.me), including:

- Homepage (`/`)
- Any subpages (e.g. `/404.html`, `/abc/abc.html`, etc.)
- 404 errors
- Invalid or unknown URLs

---

## 🔁 What It Does

- **Redirects all URLs** to `https://iabhinav.me` using Firebase Hosting `redirects` rule.
- Includes an `index.html` and `404.html` with instant redirect fallback (HTML + JS) for completeness.
